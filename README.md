# Store-change-generator
Generates the change structure in banknotes and coins for a specific cash purchase.

The function takes three arguments: the price of the product, the ammount paid by the buyer and an array containing the banknotes and coins found in the cash register at that moment.
It returns an object with two keys. The first key is the status of the cash register after the purchase and the second key is the structure of the change that must be given to the buyer.
